# **Linear Regression and Logistic Regression**

</div>

## Introduction
<div align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the basics of Linear and Logistic Regression! In this section, weâ€™ll explore the fundamental concepts and applications of these two widely used regression techniques. 
</div>

- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a technique used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

- **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is used for classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical (often binary). It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular category.

## Dataset Description

### Linear Regression
- **Title**: Employee Satisfaction Analysis
- **Purpose**: This dataset aims to analyze factors that influence employee satisfaction, with a focus on understanding and predicting satisfaction levels based on various workplace-related attributes. 
- **Feature Names**:

- **Dependent Variable**: satisfaction_level
- **Independent Variable**: last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, work_accident, promotion_last_5years, dept, salary

### Logistic Regression
- **Title**: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset
- **Purpose**: This dataset aims to analyze factors that influence employee attrition, focusing on understanding how various attributes affect an employee's likelihood to leave the organization.
