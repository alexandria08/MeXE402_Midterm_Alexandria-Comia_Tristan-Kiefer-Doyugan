# **Linear Regression and Logistic Regression**

</div>

## Introduction
<div align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the basics of Linear and Logistic Regression! In this section, weâ€™ll explore the fundamental concepts and applications of these two widely used regression techniques. 
</div>

- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a technique used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

- **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is used for classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical (often binary). It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular category.

## Methodology for Linear Regression

## Part 1 - Data Processing

### Importing Dataset
   To import the dataset, I uploaded my CSV file, used the pandas library to handle data as a DataFrame, and applied the pd.read_csv() function to read the file. This function loads the data into a structured format, converting it into a pandas DataFrame for easy data manipulation and analysis.

   ![import again](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cf5d17c-8eb8-4430-8335-97949de1417b)

### Rearranging Columns
   Reorder the dataset so that the dependent variable, satisfaction_level, is the last column. Then, use dataset_reordered.head() to display the rows and columns of the dataset, confirming it has been loaded correctly and allowing you to preview the data.

   ![moving](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ec9c908-d036-45dc-aa81-31e7ecc02576)

### Checking Data Types
Each column in a DataFrame can have a different data type, which affects how you can manipulate and analyze the data. In this dataset, there are two common data types: object (typically used for string data) and float (used for numeric data).

   ![dtypes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557efbf9-a12e-4c6c-a243-c5c457185605)

### Converting Categorical Data
Converting categorical data is an essential step in preparing your dataset for analysis or modeling, especially for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input. 

- **Label Encoding**: I used label encoding to convert the *salary* variable into numerical data, as it is an ordinal variable.

  ![salary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c34f438b-5b6a-4c02-8085-58e57cad8b8a)

     After converting the salary data into numerical values, the values became integers, so I changed the data type from integer to float.

  ![int to float](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e3333c-3a51-4b88-9f05-932f45b434f3)

- **One-Hot Encoding**: I used one-hot encoding to convert the *dept* variable into numerical data, as it is a nominal variable.

  ![hot encoding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/136f38ae-fef3-4565-9b6f-ad91e065ee34)

    After converting the dept data into numerical values, the values became bool or binary, so I changed the data type from bool to float.

  ![bool to float](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285acd92-7521-4c69-a28f-7b2415ba09c1)

### Rearranging Columns
After performing one-hot encoding, the dependent variable is not positioned as the last column. Therefore, I rearranged the columns to move the dependent variable, satisfaction_level, to the last column.

  ![hot move](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4298b3a-7006-4fe5-8987-83067fc0f938)

### Checking for NaN values
This code will help you identify which columns in the dataset have missing values and how many NaN values are present in each column.

  ![nan values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a276b6c-7613-4130-8a25-e1e550922271)

### Handling Missing Values
After identifying missing values in the dataset, I use the mean of each respective column to fill any NaN values in specific columns of the dataset_encoded DataFrame.

  ![handle missing values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00eaa29a-c499-497c-9560-492211d06627)

### Checking for Duplicates
Checking for duplicates is a critical part of the data cleaning process to ensure high-quality, reliable data for analysis or modeling.

  ![duplicates](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6a3171-a9b2-4f67-853a-33ffa3f629ad)

### Removing Duplicates
 After checking, I found that the dataset contained 787 duplicate entries. I removed these duplicates to enhance the quality and reliability of the data.

- **Mean values for model predict**: I used the mean values of each feature to create a single data point, which I used to make predictions with model.predict.
  
  ![mean values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbcb25c-9002-4049-a1cc-b5e0ed8b587d)

- **model.predict**: This code generate a prediction using the model based on the mean values of features.

## Part 3- Evaluating the Model

### Feature Scaling and Model Training
This combines feature scaling and model training for regression using Random Forests that improves model stability and accuracy by scaling the data and leveraging an ensemble method.

![scaling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4232dc19-18c7-4732-afa3-65932ddf4f42)

### R- Squared
The r2_score compares the true values (y_test) with the predicted values (y_pred) and computes the R-squared value.

![r squared](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05c7d62a-089e-4524-8c53-1ca67dd49ea0)

### Adjusted R-Squared
A modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in the model, making it more suitable for evaluating models with multiple independent variables. 

![adj r sqaured](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c8c975-bfc1-4738-956c-e2bf669707c5)

### Mean Squared Error
It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.

![mse](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847c5b36-1902-4143-a2a9-c42797bcc5b3)

### Cross Validation
This performs cross-validation on a linear regression model to evaluate its performance in terms of Mean Squared Error.

![cross val](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9002a52-4a49-49dc-b0ca-91deada37508)

## Part 4- Visualization

### Scatter Plot

## Methodology for Logistic Regression
## Part 1 - Data Processing
### Importing the Dataset
   We begin by loading the dataset to begin the analysis and modeling process. This line imports the dataset, containing both demographic and job-related attributes, which will be analyzed to identify factors influencing employee attrition.
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 141554](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/666de5ee-8cbf-4152-b905-4d1f94e84eba)

### Data Quality Checking 
   In this line, it helps identify the number of missing values in each column of the dataset. This line sums up missing (null) values per column, which helps assess data completeness. Detecting missing values is crucial for effective preprocessing, as missing data can distort model training and reduce predictive accuracy. If any columns have a significant amount of missing data, appropriate handling methods (e.g., imputation or removal) may be applied to ensure data quality.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 164744](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fb8a2a-e068-4d4d-9ce3-b0fb91dffb88)

   This line counts the number of duplicate rows in the dataset. It checks for duplicated entries, which, if present, could bias model training by over-representing certain data points. Identifying and removing duplicates helps maintain a diverse dataset and improves the modelâ€™s ability to generalize, ensuring that each row represents a unique employeeâ€™s data in this attrition analysis context.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 164921](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/436815f5-6769-4c9f-9639-44ca1b35ef7d)

   The purpose of this one is to separate the columns into categorical and numerical types for easier targeted preprocessing. This code uses *select_dtypes* to categorize columns based on data type, helping organize preprocessing steps. categorical_columns holds columns containing categorical data, while numerical_columns contains columns with numerical data. This separation allows for tailored handling of each type: encoding for categorical features and scaling or outlier treatment for numerical ones, ensuring that each variable is optimized for logistic regression.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 165127](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329b539a-f792-4a4a-972f-748604d0690f)

   This line displays the distribution of values in each categorical column. This loop iterates over each categorical column and prints its unique value counts. Understanding the distribution of categorical values is essential for identifying potential class imbalances (e.g., if a column has a dominant category) and confirming data readiness for encoding. This insight helps ensure that categories are adequately represented and informs decisions like balancing classes or combining categories if necessary.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 165147](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/670f9866-78ed-4418-94e1-33ff912c9e50)

### Dataset Inspection
   After all of the things above, we now verify the datasetâ€™s structure, types, and non-null values after preprocessing. This step checks that all variables are encoded properly and validates that columns contain expected data types, facilitating a smooth model training process.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 143832](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bff245b-4a89-4ecb-b253-e1685ff48b03)

   *dataset.head* displays the first 10 rows of the dataset to inspect data entries and also confirm preprocessing steps. This line provides a quick view of the datasetâ€™s initial rows, making it easy to verify that data cleaning, encoding, and transformations (like removing unnecessary columns and encoding categorical variables) have been applied correctly. By reviewing the first few entries, you can confirm data types, assess data quality, and ensure that feature scaling and encoding were successful before proceeding to model training.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 143858](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9c1cb4-d62c-4adf-8ab0-1eadc515cd3a)

### Encoding Binary Categorical Variables
   After importing the dataset, we convert the binary categorical variables (Attrition, Gender, and OverTime) into numeric format for model compatibility. By using *LabelEncoder*, it transforms these variables into binary numeric values (0 or 1). Encoding 'Attrition' is essential as itâ€™s the target variable (dependent), indicating turnover likelihood. 'Gender' and 'OverTime' are independent variables related to demographics and job conditions, impacting attrition.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 165635](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b27ca3-df1f-4f3f-aad9-d3af10c5e887)

### One-Hot Encoding Non-Binary Categorical Variables
   To prevent ordinal misinterpretation, we encode multi-category categorical variables into a format suitable for logistic regression. One-Hot Encoding converts each unique category into a separate binary column, ensuring categories in BusinessTravel, Department, etc., are treated independently. Dropping the first category (drop_first=True) avoids multicollinearity in the model.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 143637](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd78d2c-0bcc-49a4-bd2b-b4cc2c4a3a1b)

### Dropping Non-Informative Columns
   Now, we remove columns that do not contribute meaningful information to attrition prediction. These columns (EmployeeNumber, Over18, StandardHours, EmployeeCount) are not directly related to demographic or job-related factors that might impact turnover, so dropping them reduces data noise and improves model clarity.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 143733](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afaad33f-01fc-4496-ab59-1a4566901222)

### Defining Features and Target Variable
   Proceeding with the separation of the dataset into independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (y) as 'Attrition' (dependent variable) indicates employee turnover, while the remaining columns in X include demographic and job-related factors that may influence attrition. Splitting these sets prepares the data for model training and evaluation.
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144004](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7f80cb-2877-4a55-a31a-87f1f206c574)

### Splitting the Dataset into Training and Test Sets
   After Defining Features and Target Variable, we now divide the data into training and test subsets for model development and validation. *train_test_split* splits the data, using 80% for training the model and 20% for testing. *random_state=0* ensures reproducibility, and an 80-20 split balances training model effectiveness with testing accuracy.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144004](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7f80cb-2877-4a55-a31a-87f1f206c574)

### Scaling the Features
   We continue with standardizing the features to improve logistic regression model performance and ensure consistent scaling across training and test data. StandardScaler scales each feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which optimizes logistic regression by giving equal weight to each variable and improving model accuracy.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144448](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71bdf82c-4334-45e3-a988-b2b21c504a61)
   
## Part 2 - Building and training the model
### Training the Logistic Regression Model
   On this part, we train the logistic regression model on the preprocessed training data. *LogisticRegression* learns from the relationships between independent variables (X_train) and the target (y_train). *random_state=0* ensures reproducibility, and logistic regression is chosen for its interpretability and suitability for binary classification tasks like predicting turnover probability.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144515](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6416eebc-80da-4517-bf9f-2676c900c175)

### Making Predictions
   Here, we generate predictions for the test set, *X_test*, using the trained logistic regression model after scaling the data. This line first applies the StandardScaler transformation (sc.transform(X_test)) to ensure that the test data is scaled in the same way as the training data. The model then uses predict() to output predicted classes (0 for "No Attrition" and 1 for "Attrition") for each instance in the test set. This step is essential for evaluating model performance, as the predicted labels, y_pred, will be compared with the actual labels (y_test) to measure accuracy and other metrics, ensuring reliable assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144550](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5ff537f-2591-4ec9-aded-001ebd14e298)

   This line inspects the predicted labels for the test set. This line allows a quick view of the modelâ€™s predictions stored in y_pred, which can reveal the overall distribution of predicted classes (0s and 1s). Checking y_pred helps ensure that predictions align with the expected format before evaluating model performance and comparing with y_test.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144633](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f1e122-5f34-4454-8736-51c7cab87f3b)

   And this line displays the predicted labels for the test set. By printing y_test, you can see the true values of the Attrition variable for the test set, serving as the benchmark for evaluating the modelâ€™s predictions (y_pred). This helps verify the target variableâ€™s format and distribution, which are essential for calculating metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision when comparing with y_pred.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144646](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec253f9d-ed46-43dd-9059-cc238be6d3e3)

   This line makes predictions without re-scaling X_test. Typically, scaling is required for logistic regression to perform accurately, as it aligns feature scales. Using unscaled data can lead to poor predictions and reduced accuracy, so in a well-preprocessed model pipeline, scaled data should be used (as shown in model.predict(sc.transform(X_test))). This line can be useful for comparisons or testing purposes, but in practice, it is recommended to always use scaled data with logistic regression.

## Part 3: Evaluating the model 
### Evaluating Model Performance with a Confusion Matrix
   This part assesses the modelâ€™s classification performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The confusion matrix breaks down predictions to show where the model performs well and where it struggles, which helps refine the model if needed.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144712](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3ffd88-4eea-4ab6-b4ae-5d987a4c1595)

### Calculating Accuracy Score
   This measures the overall proportion of correct predictions. *accuracy_score* is a straightforward metric, useful for initial model validation but can be misleading if classes are imbalanced (e.g., if few employees leave). Additional metrics (below) provide a more nuanced evaluation.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144728](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b71becb-1b94-4966-b161-35ff1f53395e)

### Generating a Classification Report
   This one evaluates precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. *classification_report* provides insights into the modelâ€™s sensitivity (recall), precision, and balanced F1-score for both employees who stay and those who leave, offering a more detailed assessment of performance.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144741](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f8cf40-9211-4af6-9d29-a3772d0e3e34)

### Calculating AUC-ROC Score
   This step can measure the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between employees likely to stay versus those likely to leave. roc_auc_score (area under the ROC curve) quantifies how well the model ranks higher-risk employees. An AUC closer to 1 indicates strong predictive power for attrition.

   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144755](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55ad77b-3aca-47a8-9187-03487a75da4c)

### Interpreting Model Coefficients
   And finally, this identifies which features have the strongest influence on attrition likelihood. Logistic regression coefficients reveal each variable's weight in predicting turnover, aiding in the analysis of demographic and job-related factors that most affect attrition. This interpretation helps align model insights with the objective of analyzing turnover drivers.
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-11-01 144808](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e55d91-0cf4-4574-af8a-1840bbd85f0b)

Each of these steps contributes to the goal of understanding the factors influencing employee attrition while building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of turnover based on demographic and job-related variables.

## Results

### Linear Regression

<div align="center">
 
|**Metric** |**Value**  |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| R-Squared    | 0.52   |
| Adjusted R-Squared    | 0.51    |
| Mean Squared Error    | 0.03    |
| Mean Cross Val MSE    | 0.03    |
| Standard Dev of MSE    | 0.02    |

</div>

- **Interpretation of Metrics**: 
  1. **R- Squared**
     - **Interpretation**: Approximately 51.76% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables included in the model. This indicates that while the model has some predictive power, it also leaves a significant portion of the variance unexplained.
     - **Findings**: A value around 0.5 suggests that the model is moderately effective but may not be capturing all relevant factors affecting employee satisfaction. Additional variables or a different modeling approach could potentially improve this.
       
  2. **Adjusted R-Squared**
     - **Interpretation**: The adjusted R-squared is very close to the R-squared value, indicating that the model's complexity is justified and that the variables used do contribute meaningful information.
     - **Findings**: The small difference between the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values suggests that the independent variables are relevant to predicting satisfaction levels without introducing significant noise.
       
  3. **Mean Squared Error**
     - **Interpretation**:  The value being in the range of 0.0297 (on a min-max scaled basis) suggests that the predictions are relatively close to the actual values.
     - **Findings**: This value suggests reasonable performance.
       
  4. **Mean Cross-Validated MSE**
     - **Interpretation**: The adjusted R-squared is very close to the R-squared value, indicating that the model's complexity is justified and that the variables used do contribute meaningful information.
     - **Findings**: The small difference between the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values suggests that the independent variables are relevant to predicting satisfaction levels without introducing significant noise.
       
  5. **Standard Deviation of MSE**
     - **Interpretation**:  A standard deviation of 0.0154 is relatively small, which means that the MSE is consistent across different folds and that the model's performance is stable.
     - **Findings**: Stability in MSE suggests that the model is robust and performs consistently well across different subsets of the data.
